A function that prompts the user to input student marks. The output corresponds the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


Challenge 2: Speed Detector

A program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g. 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “OK”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

 For example, if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.
